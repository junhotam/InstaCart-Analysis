# Instacart Analysis (Python)

This repository contains work, done in Python, that was completed during my CareerFoundry course in data analytics. 

### *Premise*

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

The goal of this project was to conduct analysis on, and create visualizations from, Rockbuster's data in order to help with the launch stragtegy for their new online video service.
